In this project, my main aim was to learn how to align elements with float, flex and grid in CSS. I tried doing it by creating an application that looks like the archived apple.com website.

## Built with
  * HTML 
  * CSS (Box Model, Float, Grid, Flex and Positioning)
  * Lint (Stickler)
  * W3C Validator

## Getting started
**I cloned an archived copy of Apple website. The main aim is to ensure the elements get placed and styled roughly the same way as the source, so functionality is not a priority.**

I used the browserâ€™s developer tools to inspect the real Apple archive web page to understand how elements are placed and styled.
I built my own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. We carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all our styling code will reside
